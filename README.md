### Predictive Analysis for Marketing Campaigns (R)
Within this MIS term project, my team and I created predictive models to forecast the propensity for an individual to join a subscription plan.
We were able to gather metadata on customers ranging from age ranges, average meals ordered, etc. Our group tested the multitude of variables
to test which ones would have the most significant impact through step-wise variable selection. In the end, we found a neural network model that allowed us
to present the most significant variables for customers to join the subscription. We created visualizations to showcase our findings and showcased possible
next steps for the company to increase their subscription rate.

### SQL Database for Coffee Shop (SQL)
Creating a SQL database from scratch can be quite difficult but with the proper planning, diagrams and process, we can break down a business in a very understandable format.
To begin, my group and I determined what would be the most accurate source of information for the coffee shop and began to create metadata, use cases and entity relationship diagrams
to piece the puzzle together. By breaking down their process into these use cases and understanding which entities are involved, we were able to begin creating a database within MySQL. My group was able to successfully create a database within SQL and could add, remove or interact with entities as needed. If the shop ever expanded or had new processes, future users would be able to modify the database as needed.

### Power BI Visualization  (Power BI, Excel)
At one of my jobs, one of my main client projects that I tackled was a data visualization project focused around helping key stakeholders understand their business from a top-down view. Our stakeholders encountered challenges with tracking important key performance indicators at their work sites. At the beginning of the project, I discovered the business and data requirements by interviewing the end-users and owners of their current database. Once the requirements were determined, I developed a Power BI dashboard that tracked their key metrics which a multitude of filters to help them be able to drill down and find the exact causes of success or failure. To go above and beyond, I created a companion PowerApp that helped employees validate information and increase overall data consistency.

### Automated DataBricks Solution (Python, Excel, DataBricks)
One client that I've interacted with had a problem with loading particular data into their Azure databases. With this project, I worked with the client to discover the data they needed and began building out a DataBricks solution to solve it. First, I coded a python script that was able to gather the data they needed and transform it to match their data structures. To help reduce manual workload for the users, I made a DataBricks workflow that would automatically execute the script each day and upload the newly created .CSV files into the client's specific Azure storage workspace. The client was exceptionally happy about the outcome and appreciated the automation and integration into cloud technologies.
